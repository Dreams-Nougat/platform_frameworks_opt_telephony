Based on the description of the change, shouldn't we make a change here to make sure useImsForUt is true in case of Ims over CDMA so that the request can go over ImsPhone?

The current change only makes sure that even if it is a CDMA phone we handle MMI over RIL if IMS is enabled. The request still isn't going over IMS, is it?

The current change is a reference for only the USSD over CDMA-IMS scenario (not UT/Supplementary Services). Since USSD is not supported over ImsPhone (ImsPhoneMmiCode) anyways, this change appears to be CS-only.

The change is an reference (using USSD as an example) on how all MMI codes - supplementary service (UT), and USSD - can be handled over CDMA-IMS scenarios. For the full CDMA-IMS functionality, more refactoring will be required in AOSP to route the MMI codes over ImsPhone -> ImsPhoneMmiCode
